##### Gameplay involves aiming and shooting at the skeleton enemies, sharp blocks are indestructible and ducky cannot walk over them, and they are able to stop ducky's projectile.

# Create a map

## Here the user can create custom maps to play that can be saved and played at any point.

### To create a map the user must add at least one duck, name and save the map.
